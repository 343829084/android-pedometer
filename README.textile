_Android app, that watches your every step_

Pedometer is an application for Android phones.

h2. Features

It counts your steps by using the sensors in the phone.

It calculates the pace (steps per minute), and can help you maintain a desired pace by speaking to you. It will ask you to install the Text-to-Speach library if you enable this option.
